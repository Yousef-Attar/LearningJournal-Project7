                    <p>I'm a Computer Science student who started this journal to share my journey of learning, growth, and passion for technology. My goal is to become a skilled full stack web developer and build real-world applications that make a difference.</p>

                <h2>How it all started</h2>
                <p>In 2022, I began studying Computer Science at university. After completing my first year, I took a robotics course and became fascinated with automation, sensors, and physical computing.</p>
                <p>But at the same time, I discovered a strong passion for web development and decided to dive deeper into that world. I joined the Frontend Developer Career Path on Scrimba, where I started building real projects and learning modern web tools.</p>
                <h2>Where I am now</h2>
                <p>After finishing the frontend path, I continued into the Full Stack Developer Career Path to learn backend technologies like Node.js, SQL, TypeScript, Express, and even AI integration with advanced React and Next.js.</p>
                <p>I'm currently also working as a Coding and Robotics Teacher at BrightChamps, teaching students from different countries and helping them fall in love with programming the way I did.</p>
